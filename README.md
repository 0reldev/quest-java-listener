# Quest "Design Pattern 02: Observer"

## Educational exercice from Wild Code School

This quest teaches how to use the observer design pattern, especially event listeners.

A `Bank` class and a `Transactions` class are given. The objective is to use an event listener to apply a €100 withdrawing on a bank account where there are €1000.

The operation result is displayed to check if everything worked.
